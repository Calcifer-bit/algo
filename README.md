1. Array
2. Linked List : reduce the space wastage Linked List is formed which adds a node only when a new element is introduced. Insertions and deletions also become easier with linked list.One big drawback of linked list is, random access is not allowed
  1->2->3->4->NULL
 NULL<-1<->2<->3->NULL
  1->2->3->1 [The next pointer of last node is pointing to the first]
  
3. Stack: maintaining function calls,in cases where we have to reverse a word, check for balanced parenthesis and in editors where the word you typed the last is the first to be removed when you use undo operation, browser back button
4. Queue :  to the queues of bus stop or train where the person who is standing in the front of the queue(standing for the longest time)
is the first one to get the ticket.
include CPU scheduling, Disk Scheduling. Another application of queue is when data is transferred asynchronously (data not necessarily received at same rate as sent) between two processes. Examples include IO Buffers, pipes, file IO, etc.
 

5. Binary Tree 
each node has at most two children, It is implemented mainly using Links.They are useful in File structures where each file is located in a particular directory and there is a specific hierarchy associated with files and directories.storing heirarchical objects like JavaScript Document Object Model considers HTML page as a tree with nesting of tags as parent child relations.

6. Binary Search Tree
.The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node’s key.
.The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
.. The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
For example in implementation in E- commerce websites where a new product is added or product goes out of stock and all products are lised in sorted order.

7. Binary Heap
9. Hashing
